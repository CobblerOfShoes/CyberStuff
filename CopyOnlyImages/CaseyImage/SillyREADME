Hello children, this is Alex Schumann. Unfortunately, Casey Nazelrod is a sub-par training lead that is incapable of fulfilling the bare minimum job requirements of making practice content. Now you may be asking, how could a high school Sophomore be too busy over Christmas break to spend a few hours making a Fedora image? Well, I have two hypotheses:

1) As I am writing this README, Casey "Mid Ginger butt man" Nazelrod is skiing in Pennsylvania. If he had to actually do his job that he signed up for, when would he have time to goof off and be in a silly goofy mood :( ? If for some silly reason he tries to argue this, please text me at 443-204-5919 and I will reply with the picture he posted on his public story of him on a ski lift. Good job Casey!

2) Casey probably couldn't figure out how to download Fedora 36, since 37 is now the only version on Fedora's main website. He probably did about 5-10 minutes of Googling then said, "Wait, if I actually figured this out then I wouldn't be giving the entire LT a reason to be mad at me!"

Do not fear, I, the single most greatest member to have ever be Head Linux Man,  have returned from the dead to pick up the slack of what may be the worst LT in history. For any concerns about this claim, please direct your attention to "slow-mode" in the cyber Discord.

Remember, if at any point you get frustrated and think something along the lines of "This image sucks!" remember that this is no longer my job and it is out of the kindness of my heart that I am making this image instead of sleeping in till 7 P.M. Furthermore, as St. Ignatius would say, this would be a good time to reflect on the great school year of 2021-2022 and remember the utter Hell that you little gremlins caused me. 

Some words of advice:

-Hill, you probably aren't reading this because you're too busy talking to Idiots 1 and 2.
-McLaughlin, sell your body on your own time, not during training time.
-Hiller, who am I kidding there's no way Hiller hasn't given up by now.
-Nathan, I hope whatever game you moved onto after No Mans Sky is a completely soul crushing experience that makes you stop and think, "Hm. Maybe if for once I actually did what I was supposed to be doing" but you will probably instead think "What if I did a little trolling and play on my phone the entire time we are receiving directions and then have absolutely no idea what I am supposed to be doing."
-Anshul, cope harder.
-Rocca, its not too late to switch to Windows.
-Cole, whenever you are competing, stop and think "Have I gained points in the last hour?" and when you tell yourself no, move onto something else.
-Keller (Dylan Keller, not the stupid dumb stupid Keller), you do the most self teaching out of anyone, but maybe do it in a less Connor Dorsey way.
-Casey, fuck you.
