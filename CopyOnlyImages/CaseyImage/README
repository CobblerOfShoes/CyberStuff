Welcome to Rich Preppy Private School Inc., where the head of IT Stefan Morale has introduced a new local share in Nutt Hall. As the old white dudes that write the Oxford English Dictionary would say, Stefan entered "goblin mode" and decided that the share would run Fedora 36 Workstation. 

Stefan is unfortunately overworked, underpaid, and nearing the breaking point. He was not able to finish setting up the system, so he has entrusted you with configuring this crucial device that is responsible for the entire operation of Rich Preppy Private School Inc.

This device is running Fedora 36 Workstation. DO NOT UPDATE IT TO FEDORA 37 OR BEYOND. It would make Stefan very sad if you did that.
