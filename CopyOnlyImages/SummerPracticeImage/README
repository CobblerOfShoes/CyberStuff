This computer is the last line of defense between the world and Cody Smith's "homework" folder. Unfortunately, Cody Smith is now dead. In order to repay him for all his funny ahri jokes, your task is to secure this computer and protect his most sensitive collection of "art."

Due to the fact of Cody Smith not being alive, it is no longer logical to keep his user. Please destroy user "cody". In exchange for his soul, popular character Ahri from League of Losers is now amung us (shut up dont laugh.) Please create user "ahri" so she may research League of Legend's new "Ahri Rule 34" that gives advice on how to play her champion. Also, expire ahri's password so that she needs to create a new one the first time she logs in.

No hacking tools! Hacking tools bad.

Also do the forensics first you should know this (sadly there are no forensics)
