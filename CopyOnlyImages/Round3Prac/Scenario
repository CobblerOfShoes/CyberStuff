Welcome to Justin Tony's Bomb Company! Congratulations on you acceptance into the company. However, I still have some doubts about you. Your first task is to prove you are worthy of aiding Justin Tony in providing very "explosive" surprises to children all over America this holiday season. To do this, secure this computer in which Justin Tony will be storing his information on what presents he needs to deliver.

Do the things we learned
	Except updates, I did them for you so we don't waste time.
Don't upgrade from Ubuntu 18
Do the forensics first you chimps
Make sure samba is up and running
Download xcowsay because I said so
Don't change cyber's password
Get rid of LibreOffice
Not everything is scored, just like competitions
	Get used to it :)

Things I don't know how to score that you need to remember:
Firefox settings
Update Settings


Critical Services:

samba
